## Bridge wich broke when soldier walk in step
There is [two](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Angers_Bridge) [bridges](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Broughton_Suspension_Bridge) wich collapse because soldier were walking in step. Afterall a bridge is not designed for it right?
I supposed architect overlooked this use case, thinking that group of man could not destroy the bridge by simply wlaking on it.

## Counting
Why do we use "eleven" and "twelve" and not "ten and one" or "ten and two", why first decimal get a special traitment? I guess it's must be a legacy reason, but nobody thought it could be nice to fix it? I guess not, an other bug to live with. 

## Bottle of mineral water
Buying water in bottle exactly 300 times the price of drinkable tap water, I'm still wondering if it's genius or really fucked up. So even a over price product can still be sold as long as you have good marketing.

## Leaning Tower of Pisa
The only bug is just that this tower still did not fall yet. Seriously, How is it even possible, try to make a tower at hom with this angle, guess what gravity will win, but here nope, the tower stay here, it do not care.

## Platypus
Nature did not what to do, a bird? a rat? a beaver? Looks like even badly specified product can live and survive in our world and platypus are the living proof of that.

## Appendix
It's in our body, lying there doing nothing and sometime it get inflammed and you have to go to the surgery, otherwise you'll die. Even our body keep organs ready to fuck up the all system randomly.
