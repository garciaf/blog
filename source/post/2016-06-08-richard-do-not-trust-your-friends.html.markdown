Don't get me wrong, I'm sure you have great friends when it comes to get a drink or playing on line games.
But when it comes to software testing you have many kind of friends ...

## Your competitor

He does not have your best interest in mind.
He will try to reverse engineer any kind of beta you release,
he will use any idea you have and use it for his own platform.
Not your best choice.

## The nice one

Some of your friends are nice, and that's good, but if you look for honest feedback, it's not the best choice.
He will try to spare your feeling, and because he knows how much effort you put in your product he will only tell you good things.

## Your developer

He do his best, but he have seen your application 100 times, he knows it by heart. And after a look he will overlook many part of he application. 
He is in a position of judge and party, and that's really hard to be critical when you are in this spot. 

## Your boss

Even if she have the best company interest, it will also hard for her to give you the best feedback, she might have some deadline, 
some commitment to her investor, and maybe she will be in the position to force a release even if she does not like your product. 
She is in a tough spot too. 

# So don't release before some pro test it
Your business is really important maybe it would be time to hire a QA or if you do not have the time or the resource, why don't use crowd tester?

They will give to you the most honest feedback because they get paid for it, and they won't be afraid to hurt your feeling but most important they will tell you everything which can goes wrong before your next

So please Richard take my advice, just make one round with some pro, because I really want to see Pied Piper succeed for once.
It has been 3 seasons, your are fighting against the entire world, I want to see a happy ending so please use my help.
