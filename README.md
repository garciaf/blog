First fork and clone it:

You need first ruby (I recommand to use [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv))and [bundler](http://gembundler.com/)

    gem install bundler

Then you can use

And you can start it this way: 

    jekyll serve
  
If you want to write and update each time you change something: 

    jekyll server -w
